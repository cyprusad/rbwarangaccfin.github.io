    <p>Tally ERP is Flexibile and it can adapt to Your Business Requirements. TallyERP 9 recognizes that in an ever changing world, process flexibility is required for businesses to stay agile. Tally.ERP 9 has a technology foundation which enables unconstrained flexibility in the solution. Tally.ERP 9 allows you to configure one or more ways to carry out the processes with appropriate controls. As a business organization it is imperative to have rigid processes coexisting with flexible processes. While Tally.ERP 9 enables controlled processes to be enforced on the organization and it also allows process exceptions as the business demands.</p>

So, whether your business has doubled and for that the production has increased to meet the unexpected demand - adding new players on your supply chain and adding new customers to the list, or reorganizing Finance or HR Dept., you can adapt to the new scenario on Tally. Its very easy in Tally.</p>
