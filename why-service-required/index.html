          <h3>WHY US?</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>Because if your company is a startup company and you think you cannot concentrate on Accounts and Finance initially or your business is growing and you think you have a great opportunity to grow but you think you donâ€™t have time or a proper growth plan.. or your accounting and finance team are not up to the mark.</li>

          <li>You may feel like your organization may not be structured in the best way to facilitate growth and efficient operation.</li>

          <li>You would like access to someone (like us), who can negotiate with your bankers, vendors, regulators, customers, unions or other outside parties.</li>

          <li>Your accounting and financial systems do not produce timely and accurate information or accurate statistics for reporting purposes and informed decision-making and you feel you are spending too much on time on the finance and accounting function.</li>

          <li>You need projections of cash flow, profits, growth, and impact of outside economic factors.</li>

          <li>Your policies, procedures and internal controls seem loose and you know you need to tighten them and also lay down best accounting practices.</li>

          <li>You would like help in identifying risks and opportunities.</li>

          <li>You could use some meaningful financial analysis.</li>

          <li>You need assistance with strategic planning and you feel that you could benefit from an experienced financial consultant for discussing ideas.</li>

          <li>You feel your company should be more profitable.</li>
